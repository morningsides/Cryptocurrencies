# Cryptocurrencies
* Module assignment located at: **module18/Cryptocurrencies/challenge/module18_challenge.ipynb**

In this module I used a unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm to group data in a cryptocurrency dataset. The first challenge was to clean the data to prepare it for Principal Component Analyses. Every step I took to clean the data and encode into a data frame falls under the Data Preprocessing section of the enclosed Jupyter notebook entitled **Data Preprocessing**. Once the data was cleaned I reduced the dimensions of the data frame using PCA down to 3 dimensions under the section **Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA**. I had a difficult time deciding on the number of clusters from the generated elbow curve but I eventually decided on 4 clusters since it had a greater angle in the elbow curve. Once I decided on the number of clusters I initialized a K means model and generated predictions and outputted the results to a data frame. Once the results were generated I joined the prediction results to the original clean data frame and proceeded to plot my results under section **Visualizing Results**. Under **Visualizing Results**, I created a 3d model and a 2d scatter plot of my results along with a hvplot table. Since the lone data point for my last cluster was so far out I used a logarithmic option on my 2d scatter plot for a tighter integration of the plots.
